# Cross Platform App Development with Visual Studio 2015 Demo
Demo project for my Cross Platform App Development with Visual Studio 2015 talk

This is a demo project that I use for my Cross Platform App Development with Visual Studio 2015 talk. It consists of five projects. Each project implments the same app: the *saved it* app. The purpose of the app is to track costs that didn't happen. So if you are on your way to work and _don't_ buy a cup of coffee at your local coffee shop, you track this as a saved item.

The five projects are:
* A Cordova / Ionic implmentation (still in progress)
* A Xamarin iOS implementation
* A Xamarin Android implementation
* A Xamarin Android / iOS implementation with shared code in a portable class library
* A Xamarin.Forms implementation
