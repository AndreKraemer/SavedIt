# Entity Framework Performance Demo
Demo project for my Entity Framework Performance talks

This is a demo project that I use for my Entity Framework Performance talks. It demonstrates ten typical performance issues. Every issue is implemented in one of the classes that implement the IDemo interface.

Each class has two methods: One that demonstrates the problem, and one that shows the solution
